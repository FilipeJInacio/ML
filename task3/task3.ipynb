    "Input files are loaded into variables *x*, *y* and *x_project*, this last one being from the *x_test* file. Commented below is a subset of code that performs outlier removal of two points who in a previous analysis were thought to be harmful for our model. But later these points did appear to have a degree of importance, especially due to them being similar to a couple of points in the testing samples. What is not commented, is the removal of four features from x_train and x_test, these same features from analysis through lasso revealed to be a little bit harmful to the SSE of our model. Thus, removing said dimensions improves our accuracy while still keeping our model structured and secure."
